Hi! My name is Murgray.

I am an Aspiring Full-Stack Engineer. I graduated in June of 2021 from Queens College with a BA in Computer Science.

I am currently studying Ruby, and then will eventually learn Ruby on Rails. The languages that I have the most experience with are Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have some minor experience with Python as well.

In my free time, I like to draw, read, play video games, and ride rollercoasters.
