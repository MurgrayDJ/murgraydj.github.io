                        I am an aspiring Full-Stack Engineer. 
                        I graduated in June of 2021 from Queens College with a BA in Computer Science.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently studying Ruby, and will eventually learn Ruby on Rails. 
                        The languages that I have the most experience with are Java, C++, and the languages 
                        that this site is written in: vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is hosted using 
                        github pages and a custom domain.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While building it, I learned a lot about web hosting, domain configuration, and 
                        basic web design priniciples.
                    </p>

                    <p id="code-card-text">
                        While it was convenient as a starting point, I've also learned that in the future I 
                        would like to use a hosting platform that allows me to use APIs and perform 
                        server-side processes.
